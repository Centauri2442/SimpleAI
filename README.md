# Simple AI | An UdonSharp based local and synced AI package, meant for use in VRChat! 

SimpleAI features multiple different forms of AI, and is meant to be used alongside the tutorial that I did as part of TLX! It is useful beyond that however, as there is multiple different AI's that you can base your own AI's off of!

I hope to expand on the amount of AI's in the future, so if you have any AI suggestions you'd like me to add SimpleAI, feel free to send me a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HZj7KQr)!

# Unity 2022 Notice

Unity has moved AI navigation to a dedicated package, found by searching AI Navigation in the package manager. VRChat has yet to properly support the newer navigation package, so you must also now mark objects as navigation static and offmeshlink static in the 'Navigation (Obsolete)' panel.
